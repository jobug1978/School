<p>My wife Joanna and I started this business over ten years ago this past April with the intent to serve some well known food but with our twist of flavor. Located in the town of Greenfield not too far from our state capital of Indianapolis. Our resturant serves those comfy foods you like to get at home as well as some of the best bbq you can find the tri-state area. We are open Monday through Sunday and have a very nice variety of food on our menu. At specific times throughout the month we bring in local talented musicians to play at the resturant to provide our customers with a different expierence than they may see at other venues. We have a very well stocked bar as well and staff that is driven to be customer first.  Our menu consists of recipes from our very own family meals.  Meals are cooked by my wife and I along with our very well trained staff.  We take pride in serving our community outside of our business as well.  Taking part in with the charity events that are ongoing through out the year we enjoy showing our community pride.
